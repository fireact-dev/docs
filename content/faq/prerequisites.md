  Required tools and knowledge for using fireact.dev
---

To use fireact.dev, you'll need:

* Node.js and npm installed
* A Firebase project (Blaze plan required for cloud functions)
* A Stripe account for payment processing (if using SaaS features)
* Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
* Firebase CLI installed for deployment

The Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go) is required for Firebase Cloud Functions, which are needed for the SaaS features. However, if you're only using the core package, you can use the free Spark plan.

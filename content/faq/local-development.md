  Understanding local development with fireact.dev
---

fireact.dev includes support for Firebase emulators, allowing you to:

* Develop locally without affecting production data
* Test authentication flows
* Simulate cloud functions
* Test Stripe webhooks locally
* Debug and develop offline

The emulators provide a complete local development environment where you can:
- Test authentication with dummy accounts
- Develop and test cloud functions
- Work with Firestore data locally
- Test Stripe integrations with test keys
- Debug your application without affecting production

This makes it safe and efficient to develop and test your application before deploying to production.

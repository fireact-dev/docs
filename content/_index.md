Fireact.dev is a comprehensive open-source framework designed to accelerate the development of production-ready SaaS applications. It integrates powerful technologies like Firebase, React, TypeScript, and Stripe to provide a robust and scalable foundation for your next project.

Our goal is to simplify the complexities of building modern SaaS applications, allowing developers to focus on their unique features and business logic. Fireact.dev comes with built-in solutions for:

*   **Authentication & User Management**: Secure user sign-up, sign-in, password reset, user profiles, role-based access control, and team management.
*   **Subscription Management**: Seamless integration with Stripe for handling multiple subscription plans, payment processing, billing portals, and subscription lifecycle management.
*   **Modern Development Stack**: Leveraging React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for a highly performant, maintainable, and visually appealing frontend.
*   **Scalable Backend**: Utilizing Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) for a serverless, scalable, and cost-effective backend infrastructure.
